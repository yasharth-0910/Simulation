### 2. Cube Configuration (Sidebar)

#### Dimension Sizes
- **Dimension 1 Size (5-50)**: Controls the size of the first dimension

  - Larger sizes = more data but slower processing
  - Recommended: Start with 10-20 for testing

- **Dimension 2 Size (5-50)**: Controls the size of the second dimension
  - Each dimension can represent different business concepts
  - Total cells = Dim1 √ó Dim2 √ó Dim3

- **Dimension 3 Size (5-50)**: Controls the size of the third dimension
  - A 10√ó15√ó20 cube has 3,000 total cells
  - Each cell contains a value (e.g., sales amount)

#### Technique Selection
- **Technique for Dimension 1**: Choose how to optimize the first dimension
  - **Prefix Sum (PS)**: Best for read-heavy workloads
  - **SRPS**: Balanced approach, good for most cases
  - **SDDC**: Best for hierarchical data

## üîç Understanding the Concepts

### What is a Data Cube?
A data cube is a multidimensional array where each cell contains a value. Think of it like a 3D spreadsheet:
- **Example**: Sales data with dimensions: Region √ó Time √ó Product
- **Cell value**: Sales amount for that specific combination
- **Query**: Sum all sales in a rectangular region

### What are Range Queries?
A range query asks: "What is the sum of all values in this rectangular region?"
- **Example**: "Total sales for regions 0-2, time periods 1-5, products 0-3"
- **Result**: Sum of all cells in that rectangular box
- **Challenge**: Computing this efficiently for large cubes

### What are Updates?
An update modifies a single cell and must propagate the change:
- **Example**: "Add $100 to sales for region 1, day 5, product 2"
- **Challenge**: Updating the preprocessed data efficiently
- **Trade-off**: Faster queries usually mean slower updates

### What are 1D Techniques?
Each dimension can be optimized differently:
- **Prefix Sum**: Pre-computes cumulative sums (fast queries, slow updates)
- **SRPS**: Uses blocks with anchors (balanced performance)
- **SDDC**: Uses binary trees (logarithmic costs)
- **LPS**: Custom partitioning (flexible but complex)

## üéØ Best Practices

### Choosing Dimension Sizes
- **Start small**: Use 5-10 for testing
- **Scale up**: Increase to 20-50 for realistic scenarios
- **Consider memory**: Larger cubes use more memory
- **Balance**: Too small = not realistic, too large = slow

### Choosing Techniques
- **Read-heavy**: Use Prefix Sum or SDDC
- **Update-heavy**: Use SRPS or LPS
- **Balanced**: Use SRPS or SDDC
- **Custom patterns**: Use LPS with specific configuration

### Interpreting Results
- **Correctness**: IDC results should match brute force (small difference)
- **Performance**: Construction time should scale reasonably
- **Trade-offs**: Look for Pareto optimal configurations
- **Scaling**: Performance should follow theoretical predictions

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Slow performance**: Reduce dimension sizes
2. **Memory errors**: Use smaller cubes
3. **Incorrect results**: Check that techniques are implemented correctly
4. **Import errors**: Make sure all dependencies are installed

### Performance Tips
1. **Start with small cubes**: 5√ó5√ó5 or 10√ó10√ó10
2. **Use balanced techniques**: SRPS or SDDC for most cases
3. **Monitor memory**: Large cubes can use significant memory
4. **Test correctness**: Always verify against brute force
